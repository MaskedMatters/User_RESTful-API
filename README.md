# User Restful API
This repo has code for a RESTful API server that has a JSON database and the ability to list users, add users, and delete users.

Specifically, it uses the Express.js framework library to handle server endpoints for the different uses of the API. It handles the GET requests (list requests), POST requests (add requests), and DELETE requests (self-explanatory.)
